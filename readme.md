Hey I'm Emily!
---

I'm a software engineer who specializes in front end but does full stack for a living. Nowadays, coding's just a work thing for me - most of my time's really spent running marathons, consuming loads of boba, and going on super fun adventures. I'm also crazy passionate about youth development and LGBTQIA+ activism, and can be found volunteering at schools or fighting for my community's rights.  Hope you enjoy my work!

**ATTENTION: Lately, my projects have been repeatedly plagiarized, stolen, and resubmitted to hackathons. My hackathon projects are my only repositories that do not have a license, and thus are protected under U.S. Federal Copyright. I will be in contact with Devpost and MLH to ban you, as well as the proper authorities if need be.***
